# sleepRecording_v9

Bugs to be fixed:
1. timestamp1.txt and timestamp2.txt must be closed (during Delay)
2. Resetting channel before starting the experiment for individual mice (currently, the default setting is "meEM", but "channels" variable for each mouse should control this)

NREM detection
Still
